Dental implants are a reliable and advanced way to get your lost smile back. Patients recovering lost teeth with the help of implants will enjoy dysfunction and beautiful smiles for years to come. This method can be safely considered one of the most important dental achievements, but, unfortunately, not everyone dares to choose an implant due to common myths.

## Myth No. 1 – Dental Implants Are Not Worth The Money

Dental implants are considered to be the gold standard of tooth replacement, which means that the cost is higher than dentures or bridges. Implant procedures are not always covered by dental insurance either. However, there are many reasons that dental implants are worth the cost. For one, getting a dental implant to replace a missing, broken, or severely decayed tooth will preserve the jaw bone and keep it from being resorbed. Another factor to consider is that a dental implant will most likely last for your lifetime, as opposed to bridges and dentures which will need to be replaced every so many years.

## Myth No. 2 – Dental Implants Involve Lots of Pain and Long Procedures

At first glance, dental implants can look complicated or painful. In fact, modern dentistry is so complex that there is no reason to fear surgery. Under local anesthesia, dental implants are performed quickly and painlessly in 30-40 minutes. Also, patients with severe allergies can be anesthetized. When operated under the supervision of an anesthesiologist, semi-active diseases develop. There is no pain or fear during surgery, and you can enjoy a refreshing, refreshing smile as soon as you wake up.

## Myth No. 3 – Dental Implants Require a Lot of Care

Compared to implants, the shape and function of the crown is similar to that of natural teeth. The treatment is the same. For regular dental checkups and oral hygiene measures, brush twice daily with a toothbrush and floss.

## Myth No. 4 – Dental Implants Have Healing Complications

Dental implants have a very high degree of adhesion – up to 99%. Specialized implant technologies, implant alloys and unique implant surfaces all contribute to excellent results. These unique properties accelerate the healing and formation of bones, increase the blood supply to the bone tissue and reduce inflammation.

## Myth No. 5 – Dental Implants Do Not Last for Long

Dental Implants are not the only way to restore teeth, but they may be the only way to help you for life and protect you from the negative effects of tooth loss. With a lifetime dental implant warranty, patients can be confident that the highest quality results will last for decades.

## Myth No. 6 – Dental Implants May Damage Healthy Teeth

When restoring lost teeth with dental implants, there is no need to prepare healthy teeth. Thus, replacing missing teeth is a safe solution that does not damage the surrounding natural teeth.

## Myth No. 7 – Dental Implants Look Fake

On the contrary, a lot of patients are often surprised by how real their dental implants look. When meeting people for the first time, or even when facing friends and family, they will not notice unless you tell them you have teeth implants. Although your loved ones will see a striking difference, they will be more astounded at how natural the implants look.

## Myth No. 8 – Dental Implants Are for Old People Only

There are a few different reasons that this myth is completely ungrounded. People of all ages can opt to get dental implants and they do, in mass numbers. Dental implants may have become associated with older people because your teeth weaken as you age, making it more common in older patients. However, younger adults are actually better candidates for dental implants because they are less likely to suffer from bone loss or bone weakness, meaning it is more likely that there will be sufficient jaw bone to support an implant. It’s also best to replace a tooth with an implant sooner rather than later. The longer you let a damaged or missing tooth go, the more problems that can occur, such as jaw bone resorption and shifting teeth.

## Myth No. 9 – Dental Implants Tend to Fall Out

The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons report that 95% of dental implants are successful. In rare cases, the implant may fall out, loosen, or fail to bond.
However, the majority of patients never have issues with dental implants becoming loose or falling out.

## Myth No. 10 – Dental Implants Can Be Ineffective and Risky

Dental implants have been a popular solution for tooth loss for more than 40 years. In that time, this dental procedure has had an impressive success rate compared with other tooth replacement treatments.
Most patients with dental implants enjoy the benefits for many years, which make them a smart investment.

## Myth No. 11 – Dental Implants Cause Headaches

A more recent myth is that titanium within the dental implant causes headaches or migraines. However, there is no clinical research that supports this claim.
If you do experience severe headaches after receiving dental implants, there may have been a complication during surgery. Although rare, dental implants could damage nerves or the sinus cavity.
A misaligned bite (aka. TMJ), could also cause headaches after a dental implant procedure. A cosmetic dentist can likely identify and resolve the cause of your headaches if it is related to your implants.
