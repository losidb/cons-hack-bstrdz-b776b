Dental implants are a reliable and advanced way to get your lost smile back. Patients recovering lost teeth with the help of implants will enjoy dysfunction and beautiful smiles for years to come. This method can be safely considered one of the most important dental achievements, but, unfortunately, not everyone dares to choose an implant due to common myths.

## Myth No. 1 – Dental Implants Are Not Worth The Money

Dental implants are considered to be the gold standard of tooth replacement, which means that the cost is higher than dentures or bridges. Implant procedures are not always covered by dental insurance either. However, there are many reasons that dental implants are worth the cost. For one, getting a dental implant to replace a missing, broken, or severely decayed tooth will preserve the jaw bone and keep it from being resorbed. Another factor to consider is that a dental implant will most likely last for your lifetime, as opposed to bridges and dentures which will need to be replaced every so many years.

## Myth No. 2 – Dental Implants Involve Lots of Pain and Long Procedures

At first glance, dental implants can look complicated or painful. In fact, modern dentistry is so complex that there is no reason to fear surgery. Under local anesthesia, dental implants are performed quickly and painlessly in 30-40 minutes. Also, patients with severe allergies can be anesthetized. When operated under the supervision of an anesthesiologist, semi-active diseases develop. There is no pain or fear during surgery, and you can enjoy a refreshing, refreshing smile as soon as you wake up.

## Myth No. 3 – Dental Implants Require a Lot of Care

Compared to implants, the shape and function of the crown is similar to that of natural teeth. The treatment is the same. For regular dental checkups and oral hygiene measures, brush twice daily with a toothbrush and floss.
